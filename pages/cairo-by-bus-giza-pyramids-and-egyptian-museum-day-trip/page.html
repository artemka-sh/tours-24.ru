  Description
 </h3>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Take a day trip to Cairo from Sharm El Sheikh by a comfortable air-conditioned coach. Visit key sites like the Pyramids and the Sphinx on the Giza plateau, and the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities on Tahrir Square. Learn about the ancient Egyptian artifacts from an expert guide as you go.
  </li>
  <li>
   Get picked up from your hotel in Sharm El Sheikh for a trip to Cairo. Upon arrival, a guide takes you to the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities in Tahrir Square.
  </li>
  <li>
   Discover a huge collection of artifacts from Ancient Egypt, including statues, sarcophagi, and precious jewels. Encounter the treasures of Pharaonic Egypt, such as the 6 gilded King Tutankhamun coffins, with your guide’s help.
  </li>
  <li>
   You will have some time here to take an optional boat trip on the Nile, before stopping to enjoy a delicious buffet lunch of typical Egyptian cuisine on the banks of the river. After your meal, drive out to the Giza plateau.
  </li>
  <li>
   Explore the Pyramids on the Giza plateau, one of the wonders of the ancient world built more than 4,500 years ago as a monument to the pharaohs Cheops, Chephren, and Mykerinos. Gaze at the face of the mysterious Sphinx, and hear about the solar boat that Cheops built to sail through the underworld.  Optionally, you can choose to use some of your time here to explore the Great Pyramid or take a ride on a horse or camel around the site. End the day back in Cairo and stop at the bazaar for some shopping, then drive back to your hotel in Sharm El Sheikh.
